<!-- I tried to style this but it wasn't working to do normal CSS stuff because the content was in the app.js file, and the lecture didn't explain
I don't know how to do the styling.

also i had the following error message in the console for the site, i don't know what to do because it's mentioning something wrong with the jquery and we're not supposed to touch that:

Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'
    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (app.js:93)
    at e (jquery-3.6.0.min.js:2)
    at t (jquery-3.6.0.min.js:2)
